I observed that the expression 2^n + 2^0 is still greater than 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}, which equals 2^n. This observation motivates an important insight:
To maximize the value of r[i] = 2^{p[j]} + 2^{q[i-j]}, we should focus on finding the maximum element from the ranges p[0..i] and q[0..i].

If the maximum values from both arrays are the same, we then compare the conjugate elementsâ€”i.e., q[i - j] and p[i - j] corresponding to the indices that produced the maximum values. The one with the larger conjugate value will yield a larger result for r[i].

This is because the term with the highest power of 2 dominates the sum. Hence, even a single occurrence of a large value (e.g., 2^n) paired with any other smaller term will generally produce the maximum result.
